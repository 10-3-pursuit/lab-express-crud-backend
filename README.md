# Captain's Log

![](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2256/1635/products/4520_c-01.jpg?v=1510506828)

Every great captain, whether on the waters or in the skies, keeps a daily log.

Let's build the perfect Captain's Log App for our extraordinary captains. So that future generations can learn about life on a ship.

## Multiple Session Lab/Activity

While you will start this lab/activity today, you will have several sessions to build it out.

The different parts should align with what you are learning in lecture.

**NOTE:The most important part of this lab is the backend. However, you will want to keep up your frontend skills and complete the frontend as well since your first solo project will be full stack. React Router is not required. (but will be in your solo project)**

By the end, your app should have the following functionality

|  #  | Action  |    URL    | HTTP Verb |    CRUD    |              Description              |
| :-: | :-----: | :-------: | :-------: | :--------: | :-----------------------------------: |
|  1  |  Index  |   /logs   |    GET    |  **R**ead  |   Get a list (or index) of all logs   |
|  2  |  Show   | /logs/:id |    GET    |  **R**ead  | Get an individual view (show one log) |
|  3  | Create  |   /logs   |   POST    | **C**reate |           Create a new log            |
|  4  | Destroy | /logs/:id |  DELETE   | **D**elete |             Delete a log              |
|  5  | Update  | /logs/:id |    PUT    | **U**pdate |             Update a log              |

Bonuses in each section are not required to pass the assignment.

If you feel like you are falling behind, reach out to an instructor.

** Backend Routes HINT**: You will almost always, if not always want to return all of the array data in each route for this exercise. This will allow you to immediately set your state and automatically refresh the page... if you've placed your state correctly.

## Part 1

|  #  | Action |  URL  | HTTP Verb |   CRUD   |            Description            |
| :-: | :----: | :---: | :-------: | :------: | :-------------------------------: |
|  1  | Index  | /logs |    GET    | **R**ead | Get a list (or index) of all logs |

- `mkdir express-crud-fullstack && cd $_`
- inside the `express-crud-fullstack` directory, fork and clone this repository
- `cd` into the repository
- `npm install` (since this repo already has a package.json there is no need to use npm init -y)
- Create a basic express app including all of the package installs and files that are needed
- Create a models folder
- Inside the models folder create a `logs.model.js` file to hold your data.

The shape of each object of your data will consist of the key value pairs below.

- id: number (SERIAL)
- captainName: string
- title: string
- post: string
- mistakesWereMadeToday: boolean
- daysSinceLastCrisis: number

- Add this data below to your `logs.model.js`

```js
module.exports = [
  {
    id: 1,
    captainName: 'Picard',
    title: 'Courage',
    post: 'Courage can be an emotion too.',
    mistakesWereMadeToday: true,
    daysSinceLastCrisis: 100,
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    captainName: 'Ahab',
    title: 'Whale',
    post: 'By heavens man, we are turned round and round in this world, like yonder windlass, and fate is the handspike.',
    mistakesWereMadeToday: true,
    daysSinceLastCrisis: 20,
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    captainName: 'Sarah Lance',
    title: 'Vandal Savage',
    post: 'I’d tell you to go to hell, but you’d probably just feel at home there.',
    mistakesWereMadeToday: true,
    daysSinceLastCrisis: 0,
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    captainName: 'Ahab',
    title: 'Insolence',
    post: "I don't give reasons. I give orders!",
    mistakesWereMadeToday: true,
    daysSinceLastCrisis: 100,
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    captainName: 'Sarah Lance',
    title: 'Ava',
    post: "Ava's the kind of girl that you take home to your parents, and I am the kind you take to an exorcism",
    mistakesWereMadeToday: true,
    daysSinceLastCrisis: 0,
  },
  {
    id: 6,
    captainName: 'Ahab',
    title: 'What is sleep?',
    post: 'Sleep? That bed is a coffin, and those are winding sheets. I do not sleep, I die.',
    mistakesWereMadeToday: true,
    daysSinceLastCrisis: 5,
  },
  {
    id: 7,
    captainName: 'Sarah Lance',
    title: 'Jonah Hex',
    post: 'I know you don’t like taking orders from a woman, but you’re gonna like getting your ass kicked by one even less.',
    mistakesWereMadeToday: true,
    daysSinceLastCrisis: 0,
  },
]
```

### App.js

- create a route `/` that says something like `welcome to the captain's log`
- create a 404 route that when a user tries to access a route that doesn't exist, they will see this page

### Controllers

Create controllers that will house the routes for your logs. (rememeber to set your default route for logs in the `app.js` file)

- create a route `/logs` that returns the json for all of the logs in the data.

### Frontend

**HELPER:** To refresh your memory of making fetch calls on the frontend to an API, you can refer to the bookmarks class exercise (less complicated) or the [Frontend React CRUD Lesson](https://github.com/10-3-pursuit/unit-react/tree/main/react-crud/lesson-notes)

- Navigate into your parent `express-crud-fullstack` folder.
- `fork` and `clone` the [lab-express-crud-frontend](https://github.com/10-3-pursuit/lab-express-crud-frontend)
- Create a `Logs.jsx` component in the `src` folder
- `fetch` all of the logs
- In your `Logs.jsx` file, diplay each object from the data in a `<div>` element that dispalys each value (you may want to keep your state in `App.jsx` and pass it to `Logs.jsx` as props)
- for the boolean value you should display a string
- Nest the `Logs.jsx` component inside the `App.jsx` component and test your frontend to see if it displays your values.

## Part 2

Do not start Part 2 until you have completed at least the backend for part 1. If you are stuck, be sure to ask for help.

|  #  |   Action   |    URL    | HTTP Verb |    CRUD    |              Description              |
| :-: | :--------: | :-------: | :-------: | :--------: | :-----------------------------------: |
|  2  |  **Show**  | /logs/:id |    GET    |  **R**ead  | Get an individual view (show one log) |
|  3  | **Create** |   /logs   |   POST    | **C**reate |           Create a new log            |

- add routes for create and show
- for create you will need to create an id to add to the `req.body` since we are not using a database. Feel free to use the code below. Let's assume your data from the model is assigned to the variable `logsArray`.

`This will search for the last highest id in the array and add 1 to it` (it isn't perfect but can work for now)

```js
const id = logsArray[logsArray.length - 1].id + 1
req.body.id = id
```

- From here add the rest of the logic to add your new log to the array.

- add some logic so that if someone goes to an invalid array id they will be redirected to the 404 route you had written in the last part

### Frontend

## Show Frontend

Using your `lab-express-crud-frontend` repo:

- Create a `Log.jsx` component in the `src file` to display a single log
- `fetch` a single log using the id of the log. This should ultimately
- diplay all of the values from the data in a list
- for the boolean value you must display a string OR use a check and x emoji.
- Nest the `Logs.jsx` component inside the `App.jsx` component and test your frontend

## Create Frontend

- Create a `LogForm.jsx` file
- include inputs for all of the key/value pairs from the model except for id
- make a POST call to the backend that adds a log to the array of logs.
- test the form by placing it above or below all of the logs in the `App.jsx` file.
- the new log should automatically add to the page.

### Backend Bonuses

Add a validation function that checks to make sure that the values of each key are the correct type

- captainName: string
- title: string
- post: string
- mistakesWereMadeToday: boolean
- daysSinceLastCrisis: number

If a wrong datatype is entered, send an error, otherwise push the new data into the array

## Part 3

Do not start Part 3 until your show and create routes pass all its tests. If you are stuck, be sure to ask for help.

|  #  |   Action    |    URL    | HTTP Verb |    CRUD    | Description  |
| :-: | :---------: | :-------: | :-------: | :--------: | :----------: |
|  4  | **Destroy** | /logs/:id |  DELETE   | **D**elete | Delete a log |
|  5  | **Update**  | /logs/:id |    PUT    | **U**pdate | Update a log |

- add routes for delete and update
- add some logic so that if someone goes to an invalid array id they will be redirected to the 404 route you had written in the last part

## Delete

In the `Logs.jsx` file:

- create a Delete button
- when you click the button it should delete the log from the backend which in turn should automatically re-render (not refresh) the Logs view.

## Update

Update is always the trickiest.

- Create a `LogEdit.jsx` form
- You can use many parts of the code from `Log.jsx`
- display the values in the inputs
- on submit, the program should update the backend and also refresh the frontend based on the backend data

### Backend Bonuses

Add functionality where if a user goes to

- If you've already written a validation function, try adding it to the update route. If you have not written it yet, give it a try!
- search by name and only show names based on search. `/api/logs?captainname=<captainsName>` req.query
- `/api/logs?order=asc` it will organize the logs alphabetically
- `/api/logs?order=desc` it will organize the logs in reverse alphabetical order
- `/api/logs?mistakes=true` it will only show the logs where the value of `mistakesWereMadeToday` is true
- `/api/logs?mistakes=false` it will only show the logs where the value of `mistakesWereMadeToday` is false
- `/api/logs?lastCrisis=gt10` it will return all the logs where the `daysSinceLastCrisis`is **g**reater **t**than 10
- `/api/logs?lastCrisis=gte20`it will return all the logs where the `daysSinceLastCrisis`is **g**reater **t**than or **e**qual to 20
- `/api/logs?lastCrisis=lte5`it will return all the logs where the `daysSinceLastCrisis`is **l**ess **t**than or **e**qual to 5

**Note** the original `/logs` route should be unaffected by these additions

### Frontend Bonus

- Add Routes using `react-router-dom@6.2.1`
- Add CSS
